## Unity 2021.3.6f LTS - URP

Game based on the movie "Cube". The protagonist wakes up inside a giant cubic room, entirely consisting of cubic modules that are constantly in motion. Overcoming obstacles and traps, apparently, he will not only have to get out to freedom, but also remember his life before being placed in the Cube.
